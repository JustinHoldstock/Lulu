- Dr Morel, and Grenda look through the books and scrolls, finding nothing
- Roach finds a scroll that possesses her and summons a Tire Blue Crystal Demon. It steals the power and words from Hector's only magic scroll and explodes into a psychic shockwave. Party thrown to the walls, Morel injured.

- They investigate the guards room, finds some keys. Open a thin wooden door to see an old man seated in a banquet hall.
- They poke and prod to no avail, so they sit at the table. Hector falls asleep, the party listens to the old man ramble. Something about before... Fletcher and he capturing food... children...
- Hector still asleep, the party investigates a dark hallway, lit by Morel's lamp. She views some paintings in ornate frames, notices a crack in the floor. Is this a trap?
- Morel grabs a painting and the floor opens, falling on her head in a narrow pit.
- Hector, startled awake, comes to see what happened. Lowers Roach into the pit (now seen as a tunnel) via a chain, and she revives Morel with a sip of Elixer of Life.
- Hector and Grenda agree to stand watch while the other two investigate.
- Roach heads up the tunnel to find a greenhouse/atrium and sits to have a brew with the newfound Leshdy, who was found singing in a corner of the room by a fire
- Morel investigates down the tunnel, and finds an expansive room filled with Blackrot Sludge and smoke, a ledge by a wall covered in gemstones. A tall piller with two skeletons playing music sits in the middle of the sludge pit.
- Roach begins to feel strange, slurring and slobbering, she has been drugged. Followers of Leshdy jump from the plants in the room and attempt to kill Roach, Leshdy rushes out the tunnel, leaps up past Grenda and Hector
- The party collects themselves and rush to the greenhouse. Battle commences.
- They kill all three in a brutal manner. Blood and vomit all over the room.
- Grenda attacks a large mushroom that her blade had slipped and flew into, almost dulling her blade.
- Collectively they crawl back into the tunnel and return tot he gem ledge.
- Roach and Hector investigate a chain hook room, bloody footprints trailing in a nonsensical maner, finding nothing. 
- Grenda and Morel looking at the gemstones, Morel takes three from the wall and pockets them, enraging a Giant Worm from deep within the Sludge. They flee through the hook room and into the hallway with the trap and paintings
- Hector investigates the light at the end of the hall and is ambushed by two rabid Gnomes
- they open a hatch in the floor to see if they can use it to their advantage, and see a room below with a butcher's bench
- Roach grabs one that is attached to her head, trying to eat her mouse, and throws it out a hole in the wall into the Blackrot, the Worm can be heard hissing and crushing bone in its teeth, the Gnome heard screaming
- The second gnome launches itself into a shadow, dissappearing for good.
